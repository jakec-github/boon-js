first AND second
(first AND second) OR third
first AND (second OR third) AND fourth or fifth
(first OR (second AND third)) AND fourth
(first OR second) AND (third OR fourth)
(first AND NOT second) OR third
NOT first AND second AND NOT third OR fourth
first AND (NOT second OR NOT third)
first AND NOT ( second OR third )
first AND second OR third
NOT first AND second
first XOR second
first XOR NOT second

first OR second AND third
first AND second AND third
first OR second OR third AND fourth
first AND second OR third OR fourth
first AND second AND third AND fourth AND fifth

This one breaks the current ParsedExpression object as there is no way to invert at the top level
NOT(first AND second)

Also an interesting case
first
NOT first

What about
first OR second AND third OR fourth
first AND second OR third AND fourth
first AND second XOR third OR fourth
